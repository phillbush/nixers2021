                  Creating Your Own Troff Macros
                             Seninha

This repository contains the slides, in PDF format, used during my
presentation at the nixers.net conf 2021[1].  It also contains the
roff source code of that document.   This roff source code was not
written manually.  Instead, it was generated automatically with an
awk script called `i2roff` which converts txt files written in the
incipit format into troff documents.  This roff document should be
converted into postscript (and then to PDF), using a set of macros
that I created; those macros are in the `p.tmac` file.  A makefile
automatizes that conversion process.

At the sample/ directory, there are three files.  One of them is a
macro package containing the macros that were developed during the
presentation.   The other is a sample document written using those
macros (this document is actually the very first paragraphs of The
C Programming Language book by K&R).  And then there is a makefile
that converts those two files into a PDF document in A4 format.

The generated PDF files are distributed in this repository.
